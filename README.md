# Format note:
The sessions will be conducted via zoom.


All code can be viewed publicly at this [link](https://github.com/corybaird/SPP_Data_Seminar). This webpage will contain both the code and links to the videos for each session.

In order to get the most out of each session I highly recommend watching the videos and trying the code by yourself BEFORE attending the sessions. 

# Prerequisites:
No background in coding or theoretical statistics is necessary. 

Learning statistical software is very similar to a language, practice makes perfect.
