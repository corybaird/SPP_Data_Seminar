# Seminar goals:
1.	Understand how to install and use commonly used statistical software packages R and STATA.
2.	Learn how to download, clean and manipulate data for analysis
3.	Introduce and use statistical modelling from the basics to an overview of A.I. algorithms
4.	Consider how policymakers can leverage statistical analysis to draw insights about public policy

# Format note:
The sessions will be conducted via zoom.


All code can be viewed publicly at this [link](https://github.com/corybaird/SPP_Data_Seminar). This webpage will contain both the code and links to the videos for each session.

In order to get the most out of each session I highly recommend watching the videos and trying the code by yourself BEFORE attending the sessions. 

# Prerequisites:
No background in coding or theoretical statistics is necessary. 

Learning statistical software is very similar to a language, practice makes perfect.
